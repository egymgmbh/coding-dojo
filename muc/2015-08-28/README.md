Retrospective

Good points
- The time, ~17:00 is ok for Friday
- New participants!

Bad points
- as we finished very fast, not everyone took two turns
- too simple problem to solve
- not everyone got the whole idea during the session

What we have learned
- J solves everything (again)!
- Not being on time is not that bad

Next gojos
- trying something visual, draging buttons :-)
- something involving images generation/processing (bitmaps)
- something related to slack
