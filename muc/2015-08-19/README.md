Retrospective

Good Part
- five minutes is better than four
- we checked documentation
- Master came to the meeting *
- We finished the problem!
- The Unit testing framework is really cool!
- The people from audience didn't speak a lot
- We did some refactoring
- Better test cases

Bad Part
- We haven't learned about switch case :-(
- but the master was a bit too late :-(
- the machine had infinite money!
- We didin't use OO or FP
- We had a long delay in the beginning
- The timer is evil!

What we have learned
- make maps
- multiple return values
- error handling
- J learned how to handle the timer

Next coding dojos?
- try a problem that explores go features like concurrency
- Decide the problem in advance on Slack, so we don't waste time deciding the problem
