# eGym Coding Dojo

Coding dojo is just for fun.

## Short introduction

* Define language
* Define problem
* Write only enough code to pass the tests -> TDD, BDD...
* Baby steps
* Think loudly
* Pair programming
* Tests are not passing? No one talks to the current pilots
* Limited turn time -> 4~5 minutes
* Refactoring
* Retrospective
* Websites with tons of exercises - _Checkout the next section_
* Suggestions of problems:
```
“enhanced” ATM -> limited number of notes and concurrent withdraws
Calculator -> ((1 + 2) * 34.5 + 35%) ** 3 / (-4.2) =  -649490.89088169642857142857
Arbitrary precision?
Crazy operators? Variables?
```
